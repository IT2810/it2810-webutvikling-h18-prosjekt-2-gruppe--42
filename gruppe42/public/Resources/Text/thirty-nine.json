	"text": "Thirty-nine finds the desert lovely,\nHaving little need and much desire.\nIn her there is a hunger for pure being\nReflected in the emptiness she's seeing,\nThe bare bones of an earth consumed by fire.\nYears, like raindrops, leave the land still thirsty.\nNothingness becomes a source of beauty\nIn which one sees the end and the beginning,\nNemesis that does all life inspire,\nEach spark of light that knows what's more enduring."
